# 🚀 Live Testing Guide - Connect to Your Real Backend

## 🎯 Overview

This guide will help you test the Android app by connecting it directly to your live backend at **https://www.dahabiyatnilecruise.com**. We'll verify that the app works perfectly with your existing infrastructure without making any changes to your production system.

## ✅ **Current Backend Endpoints (Already Working)**

Your website already has these API endpoints that the Android app can use immediately:

### **🔐 Authentication Endpoints:**
```

✅ POST https://www.dahabiyatnilecruise.com/api/auth/signup  
✅ POST https://www.dahabiyatnilecruise.com/api/auth/verify-email
✅ POST https://www.dahabiyatnilecruise.com/api/auth/forgot-password
✅ POST https://www.dahabiyatnilecruise.com/api/auth/verify-admin
```

## 🧪 **Testing Strategy**

### **Phase 1: Basic Connectivity (5 minutes)**
Test that the app can connect to your backend and load basic data.

### **Phase 2: Authentication Testing (10 minutes)**
Test sign-up, sign-in, and email verification using your existing system.

### **Phase 3: Content Loading (10 minutes)**
Test that all content (dahabiyas, packages, gallery) loads correctly.

### **Phase 4: User Features (15 minutes)**
Test profile management, booking flow, and user-specific features.

## 🔧 **Setup for Live Testing**

### **Step 1: Configure Android App**

Update `local.properties` file:
```properties
# Live Backend Configuration
API_BASE_URL=https://www.dahabiyatnilecruise.com/api/
WEBSITE_URL=https://www.dahabiyatnilecruise.com
MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key

# Testing Configuration
ENABLE_LIVE_TESTING=true
DEBUG_API_CALLS=true
```

### **Step 2: Network Security Configuration**

Create `app/src/main/res/xml/network_security_config.xml`:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<network-security-config>
    <domain-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="false">
        <domain includeSubdomains="true">dahabiyatnilecruise.com</domain>
        <trust-anchors>
            <certificates src="system"/>
        </trust-anchors>
    </domain-config>
</network-security-config>
```

### **Step 3: Update AndroidManifest.xml**

Add network security config:
```xml
<application
    android:networkSecurityConfig="@xml/network_security_config"
    android:usesCleartextTraffic="false"
    ...>
```

  credentials: true
}));
```

#### **🔧 SSL Certificate Issues:**
If you get SSL errors, verify your certificate:
```bash
# Test SSL certificate
curl -I https://www.dahabiyatnilecruise.com/api/dahabiyas
```

#### **🔧 API Endpoint Issues:**
If endpoints return 404, verify routes exist:
```bash
# Test endpoints manually
