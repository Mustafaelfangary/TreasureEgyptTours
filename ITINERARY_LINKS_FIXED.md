# ✅ Itinerary Links Issue Fixed!

## 🎯 Problem Resolved

The "Explore Sacred Journey" buttons were showing errors because of problematic URL slugs generated during the Word document import process.

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### 1. **Problematic Slugs Identified**
The original import created slugs that were too long or unclear:
- ❌ `arrival-at-cairo-airport-assistance-and-our-representative-will-take-you-to-the-hotel-check-in-and-overnight-in-cairo` (126 characters!)
- ❌ `day-1-arrival-cairo`
- ❌ `luxor-city-karnak`
- ❌ `esna-el-hegz-island`
- ❌ `day-1-arrival`

### 2. **Clean URLs Created**
Fixed with proper, SEO-friendly slugs:
- ✅ `5-days-dahabiya-esna-aswan`
- ✅ `6-days-dahabiya-luxor-adventure`
- ✅ `8-days-egypt-classic-under-sail`
- ✅ `12-days-egypt-dahabiya-red-sea`
- ✅ `15-days-egypt-dahabiya-experience`

### 3. **API Routes Enhanced**
- ✅ Updated main itineraries API to include pricing tiers
- ✅ Verified individual itinerary API endpoints work correctly
- ✅ Added proper error handling and data validation
