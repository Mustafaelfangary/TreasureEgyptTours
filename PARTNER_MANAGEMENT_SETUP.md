# Partner Management & Package Media Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Package Management - PUT Method Error (405)
**Problem:** PUT requests to `/api/packages/[id]` were returning 405 Method Not Allowed

**Solution:** Added PUT and DELETE methods to `/src/app/api/packages/[id]/route.ts`
- Implemented package update functionality
- Added proper authentication checks
- Fixed field mapping to match Prisma schema (durationDays, isFeaturedOnHomepage, etc.)

### 2. Partner Management System
**Problem:** Partners were hardcoded in the component

**Solution:** Created a complete partner management system:

#### Database Schema
Added `Partner` model to `prisma/schema.prisma`:
```prisma
model Partner {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  name        String
  logoUrl     String
  websiteUrl  String
  description String?
  order       Int      @default(0)
  isActive    Boolean  @default(true)
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt

  @@map("partners")
}
```

#### API Endpoints Created
- `GET /api/partners` - Fetch all active partners
- `POST /api/partners` - Create new partner (admin only)
- `GET /api/partners/[id]` - Fetch single partner
- `PUT /api/partners/[id]` - Update partner (admin only)
- `DELETE /api/partners/[id]` - Delete partner (admin only)

#### Admin Interface
- Created `/src/components/admin/PartnerManager.tsx` - Full CRUD interface
- Created `/src/app/admin/partners/page.tsx` - Admin page
- Features:
  - View all partners in a table
  - Add/Edit partners with logo URL, website URL, description
  - Set display order
  - Toggle active status
  - Delete partners

#### Frontend Component
Updated `/src/components/Partners.tsx`:
- Now fetches partners dynamically from API
- Supports two variants: 'footer' and 'page'
- Partners displayed as clickable buttons/cards
- Redirects to partner websites when clicked
- Shows partner logos from database

### 3. Logo Management
**Note:** The navbar_logo warning is expected behavior - the system uses a fallback when content isn't found. To fix:

1. Go to Admin Panel → Website Content
2. Add/update content with key: `navbar_logo`
3. Upload logo to Media Library
4. Set the logo URL in website content

Or use the existing logo management at `/admin/website` → Logo Management section.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Run Database Migration
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_partner_model
```

Or if you need to reset:
```bash
npx prisma migrate reset
npx prisma migrate dev
```

### 2. Generate Prisma Client
```bash
npx prisma generate
```

### 3. Seed Initial Partners (Optional)
Make a POST request to `/api/admin/seed-partners` as an admin user, or manually add partners through the admin interface.

### 4. Access Partner Management
Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/admin/partners`

## Usage

### Adding Partners
1. Go to `/admin/partners`
2. Click "Add New Partner"
3. Fill in:
   - Partner Name
   - Logo URL (upload to media library first)
   - Website URL
   - Description (optional)
   - Display Order
   - Active status
4. Click Save

### Displaying Partners
Partners automatically appear in:
- Footer (if Partners component is used with variant="footer")
- Packages page (if Partners component is used with variant="page")
- Any page where you include `<Partners />` component

### Partner Buttons
Partners are displayed as clickable buttons/cards that:
- Show partner logo
- Display partner name and description
- Link to partner website (opens in new tab)
- Have hover effects and animations
