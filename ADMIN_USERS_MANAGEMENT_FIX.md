# 👥 Admin Users Management - Fixed!

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **PATCH Method Not Supported** ✅
**Problem**: Frontend was sending PATCH requests but API only had PUT method
**Solution**: Added PATCH method as an alias for PUT in the API

### 2. **API Response Format Mismatch** ✅
**Problem**: `/api/users` returned array directly, frontend expected `{ users: [...] }`
**Solution**: Updated API to return `{ users, total }` object

### 3. **Missing Role Options** ✅
**Problem**: User creation schema only allowed ADMIN and USER roles
**Solution**: Added MANAGER and GUIDE roles to validation schema

---

## 🔧 Files Modified

### 1. **`src/app/api/admin/users/[id]/route.ts`** ✅
Added PATCH method support:
```typescript
// PATCH /api/admin/users/[id] - Partial update user (alias for PUT)
export async function PATCH(
  request: NextRequest,
  { params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }
) {
  return PUT(request, { params });
}
```

### 2. **`src/app/api/users/route.ts`** ✅

#### Fixed Response Format:
```typescript
// Before:
return NextResponse.json(users);

// After:
return NextResponse.json({ users, total: users.length });
```

#### Added All Roles:
```typescript
// Before:
role: z.enum(["ADMIN", "USER"]),

// After:
role: z.enum(["ADMIN", "MANAGER", "GUIDE", "USER"]),
```
