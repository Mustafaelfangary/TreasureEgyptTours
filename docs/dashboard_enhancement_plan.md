# Dashboard Enhancement Plan

## 1. Analysis of the Current Dashboard

The current dashboard is a solid foundation, providing essential management capabilities for key areas of the application. It is built with a modular and clear structure.

**Key Features:**

*   **Overview:** A central page ([`src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`](src/app/dashboard/page.tsx:10)) with a tabbed interface that displays high-level metrics like monthly revenue, bookings, user counts, and analytics charts ([`src/components/dashboard/DashboardOverview.tsx`](src/components/dashboard/DashboardOverview.tsx:50)).
*   **CRUD Operations:** The dashboard supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for several core entities:
    *   **Cruises:** ([`src/app/dashboard/cruises/`](src/app/dashboard/cruises/))
    *   **Bookings:** ([`src/app/dashboard/bookings/`](src/app/dashboard/bookings/))
    *   **Users:** ([`src/app/dashboard/users/`](src/app/dashboard/users/))
    *   **Packages:** ([`src/app/dashboard/packages/`](src/app/dashboard/packages/))
    *   **FAQs:** ([`src/app/dashboard/faqs/`](src/app/dashboard/faqs/))
    *   **Policies:** ([`src/app/dashboard/policies/`](src/app/dashboard/policies/))
    *   **Promotions:** ([`src/app/dashboard/promotions/`](src/app/dashboard/promotions/))
*   **Other Features:** Management of contact inquiries ([`src/app/dashboard/contacts/`](src/app/dashboard/contacts/)), notifications ([`src/app/dashboard/notifications/`](src/app/dashboard/notifications/)), and general settings ([`src/app/dashboard/settings/`](src/app/dashboard/settings/)).

**Limitations:**

While functional, the current dashboard is more of a monitoring and basic management tool. To achieve "full control," it needs to evolve into a strategic command center. The limitations include:

*   Lack of a centralized content management system (CMS) for static pages.
*   Basic user management without role-based access control (RBAC).
*   Limited financial reporting beyond a simple revenue overview.
*   No tools for direct customer communication or marketing outreach.
*   Analytics are high-level and lack depth for strategic decision-making.

## 2. Defining "Full Control"

"Full control" means empowering administrators with the tools to manage every aspect of the website's content, operations, and user engagement from a single, intuitive interface. This involves enhancing existing modules and introducing new ones.

## 3. Proposed Enhancement Plan

Here is a detailed plan to transform the dashboard into a full-fledged control center.
