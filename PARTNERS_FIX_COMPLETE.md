## 🎯 What Happens When You Add Real Partners

1. **Demo partners disappear**
2. **Real partners show instead**
3. **Admin warning disappears**
4. **Professional look**

---

## 📊 Component Logic

```typescript
// Before (OLD - returned null):
if (partners.length === 0) {
  return null;  // ❌ Nothing shows
}

// After (NEW - shows demo partners):
const displayPartners = partners.length > 0 
  ? partners              // ✅ Real partners
  : [mockPartner1, mockPartner2];  // ✅ Demo partners

const showAdminNotice = partners.length === 0;  // ⚠️ Show warning
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

### **Before Deployment (Local):**
```bash
npm run dev
```

Scroll to bottom - you should see Partners section

### **After Deployment (Production):**
Visit: `https://www.dahabiyatnilecruise.com/packages`
