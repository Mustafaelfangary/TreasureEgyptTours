# 🔧 Admin Panel Fixes - Complete Summary

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **User Management - Edit/View/Delete Functionality** ✅

**Problem**: Buttons in `/admin/users` were not functional - couldn't edit, view, or delete existing users.

**Solution**: 
- ✅ Added `handleViewUser()` function - Opens modal with user details
- ✅ Added `handleEditUser()` function - Opens edit modal with pre-filled data
- ✅ Added `handleUpdateUser()` function - Updates user via API
- ✅ Added `handleDeleteUser()` function - Deletes user with confirmation
- ✅ Created **Edit User Modal** - Full form to edit name, email, password, role
- ✅ Created **View User Modal** - Display user details with edit button
- ✅ Connected all buttons to their respective functions

**Now You Can**:
- Click **"View"** to see user details
- Click **"Edit"** to modify user information
- Click **"Delete"** to remove users (with confirmation)
- Edit user roles (Admin, Manager, Guide, User)
- Change passwords
- Update names and emails

### 2. **Admin Dashboard Grid Layout** ✅

**Problem**: Grid was forced to show 1 box per line instead of 3 boxes per line on large screens.

**Solution**:
Changed all grid layouts from:
```tsx
// Before
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-4">
```

To:
```tsx
// After
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4">
```

**Fixed Sections**:
- ✅ Stats Grid (Bookings, Users, Packages, Revenue)
- ✅ Core Management (Bookings, Dahabiyas, Users)
- ✅ Content Management (Website, Packages, Itineraries)
- ✅ Operations (Availability, Gallery, Reviews)
- ✅ System & Settings (Settings, Email, Notifications)

**Result**:
- **Mobile (< 640px)**: 1 column
- **Tablet (640px - 1024px)**: 2 columns
- **Desktop (> 1024px)**: **3 columns** ✅
